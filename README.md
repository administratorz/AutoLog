# AutoLog

A simple yet powerful Keylogger written in AutoIt. The compiled version of Run.au3 is only detected by 3 Scanners on virustotal.com (Fortinet, Jiangmin & Zillya).

## Features:
* Logs Keyboards with EN-Layout (other Layouts are also working when it comes to letters and numbers)
* Case-Sensitive-Logging
* Creates an easy-to-read HTML-File with the logged content
* Logs a specified window (e.g. Firefox)
* Sends information to a server
* The server can generate HTML-files for every logged client

## Bugs:
* Doesn't delete the temporary file on program-exit

## Todo:
* Let the Keylogger do a cleanup of the temporary file at program-exit

## Tested under:
* Windows 7
* Windows Vista
* WINE (Windows 8 Mode)
